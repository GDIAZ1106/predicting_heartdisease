## Technologies Used
### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

### Database Storage
Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is 90/10. 

### Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard.

## Communication Protocols
- Team members will communicate using the #final-project Slack channel.
- Team members will meet at least 1x per week.
- Team members will plan next time they meet at the end of every meeting-- being flexible and open to each other's schedules.
- Team members will communicate with each other in the case they need internal deadline extensions or help with their part of the project.
- Team members will distribute work evenly amongst each other and be repsonsible for their distribution.
